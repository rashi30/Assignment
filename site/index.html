<h1>Building a Simple HTML Page</h1>
<div>
<p>In just years since its inception, the <strong>World Wide Web</strong> (or web for short) has become an integral part of daily life for millions of people around the world. According to internetworldstats.com, the Internet had over billion users as of June , with more new users every day, most using mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to access their preferred web sites. Imagine your daily life without access to your favorite social media,news, entertainment, and shopping sites. Most of us have integrated the web to such a degree in our lives that we cannot resist constantly checking email, Twitter feeds, Facebook,
and the myriad of other online media that have become an essential part of our daily lives. Despite the diversity of content, all of the web pages on the World Wide Web have one thing in common: They all must be created using some form of the <em>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</em>. It is astonishing to think that the entire World Wide Web, used every day by millions, is based on a simple text-based markup language that is easy to learn and use.</p></div>
